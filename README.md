# LaTeX Preview Pane

This is a fork of =latex-preview-pane= (originally
[here](https://github.com/jsinglet/latex-preview-pane)).

The reason for creating this fork is mostly to alter the appearance, build
better integration to Zotero with synctex, as well as incorporate `latexmk` as
the compilation program since this sometimes has better bibtex support.

I make no guarantees that this fork will be in any way better or 'nicer' than
the original; if in doubt, just use jsinglet's version!

latex-preview-pane is a minor mode for Emacs that enables you to preview your
LaTeX files directly in Emacs. It supports PDF previews, your choice of pdflatex
or xelatex, and it highlights errors in your LaTeX buffer.
 
Please see the documentation for latex-preview-pane over on EmacsWiki, here:
